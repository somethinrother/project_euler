current_prime = 2
# Define method to find the next prime after current prime

# Define method that accepts the number to be factorized, divides the number by
# current_prime until it is not a whole number. It then increments the current_prime
# and starts again. This ends when the number to be factorized, having been
# divided, is prime itself
